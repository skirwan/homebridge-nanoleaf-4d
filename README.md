# homebridge-nanoleaf-4d

This plugin exposes a simple `Switch` accessory for enabling or disabling the screen mirroring feature of a Nanoleaf 4D.

## Usage

This plugin is designed to be used with Homebridge UI; it features a custom configuration UI that supports discovering and pairing Nanoleaf
4D devices on your network.  

If you really want to configure things manually, check out `Nanoleaf4DClient` for discovery and pairing.  It is non-trivial.
